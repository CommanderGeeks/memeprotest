            <h2>What Is The Meme Protest?</h2>
            <p>
                The Meme Protest is a grassroots movement that weaponizes memes to amplify voices, organize action, 
                and demand change. We believe that <em>the future is being written by those who show up</em>, and in 2026, 
                showing up means creating, sharing, and rallying behind the most powerful communication tool of our generation: 
                <em>the meme</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't about being silly. This is about being <em>real</em>. Real problems. Real frustrations. 
                Real demands. From free pizza to climate justice, from mental health to labor rights — 
                <strong style="color: var(--hot-pink);">if it matters to you, it belongs here</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're not an organization. We're not a company. We're a <em>movement</em> — chaotic, optimistic, 
                and unapologetically honest. We're students, workers, dreamers, and doers who refuse to accept "that's just how it is."
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="origin-story">
            <h3>How It Started</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; margin: 0;">
                It began in a cramped dorm room at 2 AM. A group of students, fueled by instant ramen and existential dread, 
                were complaining about everything wrong with the world. Someone said, "We should protest." Someone else said, 
                "With what? Signs nobody reads?" And then someone opened their meme folder and said, <em style="color: var(--neon-green);">"With these."</em>
                <br><br>
                That joke became a vision. That vision became a website. That website became a movement.
                <br><br>
                We're not backed by venture capital. We're not part of some marketing campaign. We're just people who believed 
                that memes — those stupid, beautiful, viral images that make us laugh and think — could actually change things. 
                And we were right.

                <div class="principle-number">01</div>
                <h3>Everyone's Voice Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    From the student demanding better Wi-Fi to the activist fighting for climate action — 
                    every cause deserves a platform. No gatekeepers. No hierarchies. Just voices.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <div class="principle-number">02</div>
                <h3>Memes Are Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    A good meme spreads faster than any manifesto, hits harder than any speech, and unites more people 
                    than any committee. We wield memes like others wield megaphones.
                </p>

                <div class="principle-number">03</div>
                <h3>Action Over Bureaucracy</h3>
                <p>
                    No committees. No meetings about meetings. You see a problem, you create a protest, people upvote it, 
                    and change happens. Simple. Fast. Effective.
                </p>

                <h3>Unity Through Diversity</h3>
                <p>
                    We don't all want the same thing. That's beautiful. Your passion for free pizza is just as valid as 
                    someone else's passion for policy reform. Together, we're unstoppable.

                <h3>Optimistic Chaos</h3>
                <p>
                    The world is messy. Change is messy. That's okay. We embrace the chaos because within it lies creativity, 
                    energy, and the raw power of thousands of voices refusing to be silent.

                <h3>No Downvoting</h3>
                <p>
                    We only uplift. We only amplify. If you don't agree with a protest, scroll past it. But we won't tear 
                    each other down. The world does that enough already.

            <h2>How to Bring This to Your Campus</h2>
            <p>
                The Meme Protest isn't owned by anyone. It belongs to everyone. Want to start a chapter at your school? 
                Here's how:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong style="color: var(--neon-green);">1. Spread the Word:</strong> Share the site with your friends, 
                classmates, and community. Post about it on social media. Put up flyers (ironically, of course).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong style="color: var(--neon-green);">2. Start Protests:</strong> Create protests specific to your 
                campus or community. Tag them with your university name so others can find them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong style="color: var(--neon-green);">3. Organize IRL:</strong> Use this platform to coordinate 
                in-person actions. Meet in the quad. March to admin buildings. Make noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong style="color: var(--neon-green);">4. Stay Independent:</strong> This movement has no leaders, 
                no headquarters, no bosses. Keep it that way. The power is in the people.

                <div class="faq-question">Is this a joke?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes and no. The memes are funny. The issues are serious. We believe you can be irreverent and sincere 
                    at the same time. That's kind of the whole point.

                <div class="faq-question">Can I really protest about anything?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Absolutely. If it matters to you, it matters. Whether it's global climate change or the lack of parking 
                    on campus — create it, share it, let people upvote it.
                </div>

                <div class="faq-question">Do these protests actually work?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    That depends on you. This platform amplifies voices and coordinates action. But real change requires 
                    people showing up — online and offline. Use this as a starting point, not the finish line.

                    Students who believed memes could change the world. We're not a company. We're not selling anything.

                    Everything is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. We don't have servers. We don't collect 
                    your data. Your protests, votes, and identity exist only on your device. (This is a demo/prototype, after all.)

                <div class="faq-question">Why no downvoting?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Because negativity kills movements. We're here to uplift voices, not suppress them. If you disagree with 
                    a protest, don't engage with it. But don't tear others down for caring about something.

                    Start a protest about it! Seriously though, this is a decentralized movement. There's no central office, 
                    no customer service line. Connect with other protesters directly through the platform.
